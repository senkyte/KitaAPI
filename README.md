## KitaAPI
## Features

It's valentines day and I'm on VSCode instead of going on a date, so why not make a mini companion with me

KitaAPI is a simple VSCode extension that fetches random Kita fanart from Safebooru for extra motivation when coding.
It refreshes to a new random image for every 10 lines of code written



## Extension Settings

Run it using Ctrl-Shift-P, and run KitaAPI: Hello World. 



### 0.0.1

Initial release of KitaAPI. Function is still called KitaAPI: Hello World. Mini issue with danbooru API fetch that results in certain images not loading for no discernable reason.
